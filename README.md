# friendfinder

On the Friend Finder site users are given a survey and finds a match with the closets similar answer. Upon submitting the survey the user's name, photo and scores are sent and stored within the friends.js file. 

The new user's scores are then compared against all other stored user's scores by subtracting each matching score and adds up that total for each user. The lowest score total(s) (if there are multiple users found with the same total lowest score) are sent back to the client and displays the results in a modal.
